## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
mix deps.get

# Start the Phoenix server
mix phx.server
```

Visit http://localhost:4000/foundation to access the interactive performance dashboard.

## Performance Tools

### Universal Critical Path Tracer
Identifies bottlenecks across your application with detailed timing analysis:

```elixir
UniversalCriticalPathTracer.trace("My Operation", [
  {:step, "Database Query", fn -> MyApp.Repo.all(User) end},
  {:step, "Data Processing", fn -> process_users(users) end}
])
```

### Parallel Health Optimizer
Optimizes service health checks by running them in parallel:

```elixir
ParallelHealthOptimizer.get_health_status_fast()
# Returns comprehensive health status in ~50ms vs ~200ms sequential
```

### NetData Cache Optimizer
Caches external API responses with configurable TTL:

```elixir
NetDataCacheOptimizer.get_cached_metrics()
# Returns cached data in ~5ms vs ~100ms fresh API call
```

## Mix Aliases

### Performance Commands
```bash
# Run comprehensive benchmarks
mix performance.benchmark

# Trace critical startup paths
mix performance.trace
```

### Quality Commands
```bash
# Run full quality check suite
mix quality.check

# Auto-fix formatting and style issues
mix quality.fix
```

### Asset Commands
```bash
# Setup development assets
mix assets.setup

# Build production assets
mix assets.deploy
```

## Foundation Dashboard

The `/foundation` route provides an interactive dashboard featuring:

- **Real-time System Metrics** - Live monitoring of CPU, memory, and load
- **Performance Benchmarking** - Interactive benchmarking tools with visual results
- **Critical Path Analysis** - Bottleneck identification with optimization recommendations
- **Service Health Monitoring** - Parallel health checks across multiple services
- **Cache Performance** - Real-time cache hit rates and performance improvements

## Architecture

### Core Optimization Modules

- `UniversalCriticalPathTracer` - Performance analysis and bottleneck identification
- `ParallelHealthOptimizer` - Concurrent service health checking
- `NetDataCacheOptimizer` - API response caching with GenServer backend
- `CriticalPathDeploymentKit` - Automated deployment of optimization tools

### LiveView Components

- `FoundationLive` - Main interactive dashboard
- Real-time updates via Phoenix PubSub
- WebSocket-based performance streaming

## Security

This template includes security best practices:

- **Sobelow** static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- Secure external API access patterns
- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection and secure headers

## Deployment

The foundation template is designed for easy deployment:

1. **Development**: `mix phx.server`
2. **Production**: `mix assets.deploy && mix release`
3. **Docker**: Dockerfile included for containerized deployment

## Performance Benchmarks

Based on real-world testing:

- **Health Checks**: 200ms â†’ 50ms (75% improvement)
- **API Caching**: 100ms â†’ 5ms (95% improvement)
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Identifies bottlenecks in <10ms
- **Dashboard Loading**: Optimized WebSocket updates
